<h3>About our terms of service</h3>

This Section will not apply to any information which is in the public domain (otherwise than through breach of this Agreement); is known by the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without breach of the obligations contained in this Agreement; or has been received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not subject to obligations similar to the obligations contained in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Indemnities</h3>
<p>You agree to indemnify us from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable legal fees) arising from: (i) your violation of any of the terms of this Agreement; and/or (ii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right.</p>
