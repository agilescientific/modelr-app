  <h3>What is modelr?</h3>
  <p><strong>What?</strong> This web application builds simple forward models of reflection seismic responses.</p>
  <p><strong>How?</strong> There are two ways to use the app: go to <a href="/">the home page</a> and use the form; or use the web API.</p>
  <p><strong>Why?</strong> We think forward models are the most important thing that nobody does, because the tools are esoteric and expensive.</p>

        <p>Built with love by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kwinkunks">@kwinkunks</a> (aka Matt Hall), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EvanBianco">@EvanBianco</a>, and Ben Bougher in the autumn of 2013.</p>
        <p>The first version of the app was built by Matt and Sean Ross-Ross in the spring of 2012.</p>
        <p>This web app is built in Python on the open source goodness of NumPy, SciPy, and agilegeo, and lots of other libraries. It was developed in Enthought Canopy and depends on the Canopy CLI. It is running on the amazing <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>. </p>
