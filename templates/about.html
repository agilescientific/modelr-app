  <h3>What is modelr?</h3>
  <p><strong>What?</strong> This web application builds simple forward models of reflection seismic responses.</p>
  <p><strong>How?</strong> Sign in and use the forms to create models. It's very easy. Still stuck? Read the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Why?</strong> We think forward models are the most important thing that nobody does, because the tools are esoteric and expensive.</p>
